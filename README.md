# Dijkstra-Labyrinth
This program, developed with Python, allows it to find the shortest path in the labyrinth. There are two different maze options in the program. The first one draws a map according to a matrix in the txt file. In this matrix, 0's are paths, 1, 2 and 3's are obstacles. The second is the option to generate a maze yourself. In this option, it forms a maze by branching towards the starting and ending notes. It finds the shortest path from the starting point to the target point using the Dijkstra algorithm in these two mazes.
 
The necessary functions for the Dijkstra algorithm are defined. These functions perform the operations of finding neighboring points of a given point and calculating the shortest path.
The Pygame window is created to visualize the maze.
The starting and target points are determined and the relevant blocks on the maze are colored.
The shortest path is calculated and the coordinates of this path are printed on the screen.
The maze and the shortest path are visualized.
